## 🔧 Technology Stack

### Core Technologies

- **Languages:** Python (3.13+), TypeScript/JavaScript, Shell scripting
- **Backend Framework:** FastAPI - Modern, fast Python web framework for APIs
- **Frontend Framework:** Next.js (15.3+) with React (19.0+) - Full-stack React framework
- **Testing Frameworks:** Playwright, pytest, Jest - Comprehensive testing across languages

### Key Libraries

- **FastAPI & Uvicorn** - High-performance async Python web framework and ASGI server
- **Next.js & React** - Modern React framework with server-side rendering capabilities
- **Playwright** - Cross-browser end-to-end testing framework
- **pytest** - Python testing framework with extensive plugin ecosystem

### Development Tools

- **GitHub Actions** - Continuous integration and deployment
- **AI PR Agent** - Automated code review and improvement suggestions

---

## 🌐 External Dependencies

### Required Services

- **GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket** - Version control and CI/CD integration for PR agent demos
- **Qodo AI Services** - AI-powered code analysis, testing, and review capabilities
- **Package Registries** - npm, PyPI for dependency management in demos

---

## 🔄 Common Workflows

### Demo Application Startup

1. **Navigate to boring-todo directory**
2. **Launch API server:** `./run-api.sh` (FastAPI on port 8000)
3. **Launch frontend:** `./run-app.sh` (Next.js on port 3001)
4. **Run tests:** `./test-api.sh` and `./test-app.sh`

**Code path:** `Scripts` → `Poetry/npm install` → `Server startup` → `Demo ready`

### Client Demo Preparation

1. **Select account-specific directory** (e.g., `Accounts/Pathlock/`)
2. **Review test scenarios and documentation**
3. **Execute setup scripts** for environment preparation
4. **Run demonstration workflows** with AI tools integration

**Code path:** `Account selection` → `Environment setup` → `AI tool integration` → `Live demonstration`

### Compliance Testing Demo

1. **Configure PR agent** with compliance rules from `pr_compliance_checklist.yaml`
2. **Create sample PR** with code changes
3. **Demonstrate AI-powered compliance checking** (SOC2, GDPR, OWASP, etc.)
4. **Show automated security analysis** and recommendations

**Code path:** `PR creation` → `AI analysis` → `Compliance validation` → `Security recommendations`

## 📈 Performance & Scale

### Performance Considerations

- **Fast startup times** - Demo applications designed for quick launch during presentations
- **Lightweight dependencies** - Minimal setup requirements for reliable demonstrations
- **Cross-platform compatibility** - Works on macOS, Linux, and Windows environments

### Monitoring

- **CI/CD pipelines** - Automated testing ensures demo reliability
- **Health checks** - Built-in validation for demo application status
- **Error handling** - Graceful degradation for network or dependency issues

---

## 🚨 Things to Be Careful About

### 🔒 Security Considerations

- **No real credentials** - All demo credentials are test/example values only
- **Compliance examples** - Real compliance rules but applied to demo code only
- **AI model access** - Requires proper API keys for AI-powered features

### Demo-Specific Warnings

- **Port conflicts** - API (8000) and App (3001) ports must be available
- **Network dependencies** - Some demos require internet access for AI services
- **Client data** - Never use real client data in demonstrations
