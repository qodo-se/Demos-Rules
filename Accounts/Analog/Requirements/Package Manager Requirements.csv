Overview
"The�Package Manager�is a core feature of CodeFusion Studio (CFS) starting from version 1.2.0. It enables users to install, update, manage, and remove SDKs, toolchains, plugins, and other components required for embedded development. The Package Manager works both via the command line (cfsutil) and directly from the VS Code Command Palette, providing a seamless experience for developers."


Purpose
The main goals of the Package Manager are to:
"Simplify installation and updates:�Users can fetch only the components they need, reducing download size and complexity compared to a monolithic installer."
"Enable modularity and extensibility:�SDKs, plugins, and toolchains are distributed as packages, allowing easy addition of new features or updates without reinstalling the entire IDE."
"Support both CLI and GUI workflows:�Users can manage packages using either the�cfsutil�CLI or the VS Code Command Palette, catering to different user preferences."
Centralize authentication and access:�Integration with myAnalog and Cloudsmith ensures secure access to internal and external package repositories.
"Automate project setup:�Required packages are installed as part of project creation, streamlining onboarding and reducing manual steps."


CFS 1.2.0
Basic package manager functionality fully implemented.
Plugins can be deployed through package manager. Basic plugin package already deployed on internal Cloudsmith.
Plugins and SDKs consumed through package manager (and installer).

CLI (cfsutils) exposing package manager APIs to the user.
Ability to install packages directly through VS code command interface (No need to use CLI from terminal).

"For testing, I think there are several avenues to explore:"
1. Make sure that the documentation makes sense to users.
2. Make sure that project creation still works (which does now involve extra steps to install required packages.)
"3. Test the cfsutil pkg subcommands and the package commands provided through the VSCode comaand palette,."
