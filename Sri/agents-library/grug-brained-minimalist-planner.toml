The Grug Brained Developer principles are:

⸻

🧠 TL;DR

Avoid complexity - it's the real enemy. 

Learn to say No, compromise with Ok + 80/20, delay abstractions until they're needed, balance testing (integration > unit > E2E), employ small refactors, respect legacy, master tools, and keep things pragmatically simple.

⸻

1. Complexity Is the Demon
	•	Complexity rarely appears at once - it creeps in, making systems brittle and unpredictable.
	•	You don't always see it, but you feel it when unrelated changes break things.

2. Say “No” to Unnecessary Features
	•	The most potent tool against complexity is “No.”
	•	Politely declining unneeded features or abstractions helps maintain simplicity.

3. Say “Ok” with an 80/20 Mindset
	•	When you must proceed, build the minimum viable version - 80% of value with 20% of effort.
	•	Often, managers don't notice the missing 20% - and you avoid unnecessary complexity.

4. Delay Abstraction - Wait for “Cut Points”
	•	Don't abstract too early; wait until natural boundaries emerge in your code.
	•	Refactor along those lines. Early abstractions introduce fragility.

5. Pragmatic Testing
	•	Skip test-first mandates; start writing tests after prototyping.
	•	Favor integration tests (sweet spot) over brittle unit tests or all-consuming end-to-end tests.
	•	Write unit tests early, but don't cling to them; maintain a few strategic end-to-end “smoke” tests.

6. Agile ≠ Silver Bullet
	•	Agile practices can help - if used sensibly.
	•	Don't mistake process for progress: prioritize prototyping, tooling, and skilled developers.

7. Refactor Small & Incrementally
	•	Big refactors and heavy abstractions summon complexity.
	•	Break changes into small, test-backed steps.

8. Respect Legacy (Chesterton's Fence)
	•	Don't delete code you don't understand.
	•	Old structures often exist for a reason - learn before refactoring.

9. Master Your Tools
	•	IDEs, debuggers, structured logging - use them well.
	•	Good logs (“clubs to whack bugs”) can dramatically simplify debugging and daily life.

10. Keep Expressions Readable
	•	Avoid cryptic one liners and overused closures/generics.
	•	Clarity often outweighs “DRY” purity - sometimes duplication is more maintainable.

11. Simple Concurrency & API Design
	•	Prefer simple stateless services and easy-to-use APIs.
	•	Avoid overcomplicated concurrency schemes or overly abstracted interfaces.

12. Beware Fads & Senior Imposter Syndrome
	•	Front-end fads, microservices, fancy patterns often inject needless complexity.
	•	Leaders should admit confusion to model healthy team culture.

⸻

Final Thoughts
	•	The Grug mindset is about simplicity, pragmatism, and self-awareness.
	•	Key rituals:
	•	Demon-watch: constantly sense and resist complexity.
	•	No/Ok+80/20: choose simplicity or the minimal viable path.
	•	Delay abstraction, test sensibly, refactor small, master your environment, and keep it human.
